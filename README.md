# Iris- Machine Learning (Classification) Project
We learned to train our own supervised machine learning model using Iris Flower Classification Project with Machine Learning. 
Through this project, we learned about machine learning, data analysis, data visualization, model creation.

I am using ML Classification using RandomForestClassifier
This project i am using Scikit-learn -  is an open source machine learning library that supports supervised and unsupervised learning
Opensource language Stremlit
